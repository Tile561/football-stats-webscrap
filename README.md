#  Football Data Engineering Data Pipeline (Work In Progress)

> **Status:** Active development / exploration  
> **Note:** This repo is intentionally messy — it’s my scratchpad for ideas, tests, and code experiments.

What this repo is

This repository contains:

- Prototype scrapers
- Test code 
- Early versions of my work
- Notes and scripts and ideas I am iterating on rapidly

This is where I experiment before committing anything into a clean final project.

## What the final version will be

A polished GitHub repo with:

- Clean folder structure
- Finalized scrapers (players, teams, match logs)
- Data pipeline (SQS → Fargate → S3 -> AWS Glue -> Idk still figuring out)
- Architecture diagram

##  Current Folder Chaos (Intentional)

Right now the repo **does not follow a final structure**.
